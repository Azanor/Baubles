Baubles is a small addon mod and API that is intended to be used by other mods to add additional inventory slots to a character.

![demo](http://i.imgur.com/lL1kdZh.png)

It adds 4 new slots: an amulet, belt and two rings slots. The baubles inventory is accessed by pressing the 'b' hotkey. It is probably a good idea to remap your normal inventory hotkey to the baubles inventory if you are going to be accessing it a lot.
