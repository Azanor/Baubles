Baubles is a small addon mod and API that is intended to be used by other mods to add additional accessories to a character.

![demo](http://i.imgur.com/lL1kdZh.png)

4 new slots are added for 4 accessory types: amulet, belt, and two rings! The baubles inventory is accessed by pressing the 'B' key. It is probably a good idea to remap your normal inventory hotkey to the baubles inventory if you are going to be accessing it a lot.
