1.0.1.9
- Update to Forge 10.13.2+ 
- possible fix for baubles dropping near player spawn location instead of at where he died.

1.0.1.8

- fix for baubles shortcut "ring" suddenly not shifting like it should when potion effects are active

1.0.1.6

- created workaround for unnecessary calls to onEquipped and onUneEquipped
- fixed a bug where onUneEquipped wasn't being called if you pick an item up from a slot

1.0.1.2
- added a simple way to switch between the normal and baubles inventory. Thanks to Vazkii for the idea and permission to port it to base Baubles.
- removed the Miners Ring crafting recipe... it is a bit op. I will leave the item in so it is attainable in creative and so it can still serve as an example bauble for devs.

1.0.0.11
- baubles are now synced to all clients on a server, allowing modders to add visual components or other client-side stuff for baubles.

1.0.0.10
- moved baubles data from player data to custom savefiles (*.baub)
- a backup file is also saved each time in case the main one becomes corrupt.
- automatically revert to backup file if main one cannot be loaded. If both cannot be loaded revert to old player data format. This will also insure that data from previous baubles versions will be loaded the first time.
